			This is easily one of the most iconic – and quotable – moments. There's a reason the blooper makes everyone giggle so much, after all: because shrieking "Pivot" at the top of your voice is just plain stupid. And funny. Moving house is boring and stressful, but get everyone yelling "pivot" as they lug boxes about and they'll be having a whale of a time before you know it.
