			We can all agree that in the age of Tinder, chat-up lines are a bit pass√© and probably best avoided. That said, "How you doin'" is likely your best bet, especially if delivered with your tongue firmly in your cheek. After all, if they don't get the Friends reference, you don't want to be dating them anyway.
