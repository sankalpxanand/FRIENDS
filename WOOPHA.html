		<p>
			The concept of being "whipped" has fallen out of favour somewhat – y'know, it's kind of sexist and that – but sometimes you really do just get frustrated about your friends being held hostage by their significant others. Chandler's lame "whoopah" is the perfect phrase for that situation, because it adds a level of silliness to the whole thing, and if you get questioned it's easy to pretend you were joking.
