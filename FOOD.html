			There is nothing more annoying in this world than someone who orders a salad and then pinches your chips. But culinary crimes aren't limited to that â€“ we've all had a housemate nicking our milk from the fridge or someone stealing a slice of pizza from the box when your back is turned. Bark that you don't share food at them (in the third person) and they won't trouble you again. If the worst comes to the worst, though, you can always threaten a Ross's-sandwich style meltdown.
