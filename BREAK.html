			 Obviously Ross was in the wrong, whatever the technicalities of the situation. But he did provide us with a very useful phrase to get us out of trouble (as long as you remember to announce that you are, indeed, on a break). Don't limit this to just romances, either - caught browsing Facebook during work? Claim you were on a break and any self-respecting Friends fan won't be mad for long.
