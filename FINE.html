			How to use it now:
		</h3>
		<p>
			Don't go full whack, whatever you do â€“ you don't want to be burning your hands on hot plates of fajitas, drinking all the mojitos and taking your trousers off to dance to the Chicago soundtrack.
			<br><br>
			But we've all been in the situation where we have to pretend we're cool about something we are really not cool about so a self-aware sigh that you're fine might garner some serious sympathy. (Also worth using: a pass-agg "I'm making FAJITAS" every now and then, especially because then you also get to eat fajitas.)
